# libtas-movie
Utility for accessing [libTAS](https://clementgallet.github.io/libTAS/) movie files.

Currently this is in a very early stage, so the following features are missing:
- Controllers, flags, and variable frame rate inputs
- Annotations (`annotations.txt`)
- Editor information (`editor.ini`)
- Modifying movies
